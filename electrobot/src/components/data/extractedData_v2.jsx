        "The Zero is a simple and powerful 32-bit extension of the platform established by the UNO. The Zero board expands the family by providing increased performance, enabling a variety of project opportunities for devices, and acts as a great educational tool for learning about 32-bit application development. The Zero applications span from smart IoT devices, wearable technology, high-tech automation, to crazy robotics. The board is powered by Atmel’s SAMD21 MCU, which features a 32-bit ARM Cortex M0+ core. One of its most important features is Atmel’s Embedded Debugger (EDBG), which provides a full debug interface without the need for additional hardware, significantly increasing the ease-of-use for software debugging. EDBG also supports a virtual COM port that can be used for device and bootloader programming.",

It can be programmed to blink LEDs, trigger relays, monitor sensors, or automate coffee makers, and with an integrated WiFi controller, the ESP8266 is a one-stop shop for almost any Internet-connected project. To top it all off, the ESP8266 is incredibly easy-to-use: firmware can be developed in multiple IDEs, and uploaded over a simple, serial interface. The board breaks out all of the module’s pins, and the USB-to-serial converter means you don’t need any peripheral components to program the chip. Just plug in a USB cable, download the compatible with Arduino board definitions, and start IoT-ing.",

        "This MicroPressure Sensor offers a calibrated and compensated pressure sensing range of 60mbar to 2.5bar, easy to read 24 bit digital I2C output. Boasts a small form factor (5 mm x 5 mm). Can be calibrated & compensated over a specific temperature range for sensor offset, sensitivity, temperature effects, & non-linearity using an on-board Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). With its ultra-low power consumption and Qwiic ports, you've got yourself a power packed little sensor!",
