The Zero board expands the family by providing increased performance, enabling a variety of project opportunities for devices, and acts as a great educational tool for learning about 32-bit application development. The Zero applications span from smart IoT devices, wearable technology, high-tech automation, to crazy robotics. The board is powered by Atmel’s SAMD21 MCU, which features a 32-bit ARM Cortex M0+ core. One of its most important features is Atmel’s Embedded Debugger (EDBG), which provides a full debug interface without the need for additional hardware, significantly increasing the ease-of-use for software debugging. EDBG also supports a virtual COM port that can be used for device and bootloader programming.",

RP2040 is a dual-core ARM Cortex M0 + chip clocked at 133 MHz, with 264 KB of SRAM and 2 MB of Flash memory. Thanks to the CYW43439, WiFi IEEE 802.11 b / g / n wireless communication is possible. The system has 26 GPIO pins that work with a voltage of 3.3 V, and a built-in temperature sensor. The Raspberry Pi Pico is programmed in C / C ++ and MicroPython via the microUSB connector.",

Note however that if you expand the picture the processor is marked RP2-B0 (actually looks like 80, if it is not B0 then its a fraud) Anyway assuming its B0, I purchased this but be aware that the B0 appears to be out of production. Current production uses the B1 processor. Good luck. I bought them Though I should add this as only one glowing review."
